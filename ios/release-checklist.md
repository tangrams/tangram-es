# Tangram ES (iOS) Release Checklist

## Requirements
- Have Xcode installed
- Have cocoapods installed
- Have ownership privileges to update the cocoapods trunk spec

## Steps
1. Go into the Info.plist located at https://github.com/tangrams/tangram-es/blob/master/ios/framework/Info.plist and update the version tag for the release you're doing. Submit this as a PR for release.
2. Once #1's PR merges, tag that commit with the same version.
3. Build the iOS universal framework for release ( `make clean  && make ios-framework-universal RELEASE=1` ).
4. Take the *universal* framework file and copy it into a branch on the framework holding repo (https://github.com/tangrams/ios-framework). Submit this for PR following the convention seen in other PRs for release notes ( https://github.com/tangrams/ios-framework/pull/17 )
5. Once #5's PR merges to master, tag the release with the same version number as #2.
6. Update the Tangram-es.podspec file version number with that same tag, and run `pod spec lint` to make sure everything is happy. Fix issues if not happy (eventually we should document known possible issues). Submit to PR once lint is clean.
7. Once #6 PR merges, push the updated pod spec to trunk: `pod trunk push Tangram-es.podspec`
8. Submit a PR to increment the version number for #1's plist file. We add `-dev` to the end of the version numbers while in development.
