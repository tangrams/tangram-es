/* Notes on TileData implementation:

Tile Coordinates:

  A point in the geometry of a tile is represented with 32-bit floating point x, y, and z coordinates. Coordinates represent
  normalized displacement from the origin (i.e. center) of a tile.

  (-1.0, 1.0) -------------------- (1.0, 1.0)
             |                    |
             |      +y ^          |
             |         | (0, 0)   |
             |       ----- > +x   |
             |         |          |
             |                    |
             |                    |
  (-1.0, -1.0)-------------------- (1.0, -1.0)

  Coordinates that fall outside the range [-1.0, 1.0] are permissible, as tile servers may chose not to clip certain geometries
  to tile boundaries, but in the future these points may be clipped in the client-side geometry processing.

  Z coordinates are expected to be normalized to the same scale as x asnd y coordinates.

Data heirarchy:

  TileData is a heirarchical container of structs modeled after the geoJSON spec: http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html

  A <TileData> contains a collection of <Layer>s

  A <Layer> contains a name and a collection of <Feature>s

  A <Feature> contains a <GeometryType> denoting what variety of geometry is contained in the feature, a <Properties> struct
  describing the feature, and one collection each of <Point>s, <Line>s, and <Polygon>s. Only the geometry collection corresponding
  to the feature's geometryType should contain data.

  A <Properties> contains two key-value maps, one for string properties and one for numeric (floating point) properties.

  A <Polygon> is a collection of <Line>s representing the contours of a polygon. Contour winding rules follow the conventions of
  the OpenGL red book described here: http://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter11.html

  A <Line> is a collection of <Point>s.

  A <Point> is 3 32-bit floating point coordinates representing x, y, and z (in that order).
