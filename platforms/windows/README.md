# Windows

## Setup

This project uses CMake (minimum version 3.0), you can download it [here](http://www.cmake.org/download/).

Make sure to update git submodules before you build:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

Builds were tested under MinGW-w64 (required). You will need to install/build zlib and curl manually.

The demo application uses the Nextzen vector tile service, so you will need a Nextzen API key to build and run the demo.

 1. Visit https://developers.nextzen.org/ to get an API key.

 2. Setup an environment variable (`SET NEXTZEN_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY` or via system settings) to point to your API key.

## Build

  The **only** supported toolchain to build Tangram ES on Windows is currently MinGW (MinGW GCC, POSIX threads). Once you  have installed MinGW, make sure that the MinGW bin folder is added to your `PATH` environment variable.

 1. Download zlib sources from https://zlib.net/

 2. Download curl sources fom https://curl.haxx.se/download.html

### Zlib and Curl under MinGW-w64

CMake typically installs everything under Program Files, which requires elevated privileges. It is encouraged you to make dedicated directory, e.g. `c:/cmake-install`. To make it work, set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` env var to this directory. The build has been tested with curl 7.63 and zlib 1.2.
Make sure that this "cmake install" bin folder is added to your `PATH` environment variable.

From the zlib source directory:
``` bat
cmake -H. -Bbuild -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=c:/cmake-install
cmake --build build
cmake --build build --target install
```
From the curl source directory:
``` bat
cmake -H. -Bbuild -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=c:/cmake-install -DBUILD_CURL_EXE=OFF -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_USE_WINSSL=ON
cmake --build build
cmake --build build --target install
```

### Build Tangram

In the root directory type `mingw32-make windows`. You can append `DEBUG=1` or `RELEASE=1` to choose the build type.

## Running app

You can open a different YAML scene file by using the argument `-f`:

```
tangram.exe -f "C:\Users\user\dev\tangram-es\build\windows\res\scene.yaml"
```
