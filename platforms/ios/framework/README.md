# Tangram ES iOS Binary Framework

[Tangram ES](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/) is a flexible mapping engine for rendering 2D and 3D maps using OpenGL ES. This repository hosts the Tangram ES iOS releases as binary frameworks. The framework has support for both device and simulator architectures.

Please try out the pod and give us your feedback in the main [Tangram ES](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram-es) repository.
