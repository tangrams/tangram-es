/**
 `TGMapView` is a flexible and customizable map view managing the lifecycle of an OpenGL ES map. This view provides
 gesture handlers for tap, double-tap, long press, pan, pinch, rotate, and shove gestures.

 The public interface provides dynamic map marker placement, change of camera view settings, and map description changes
 through scene updates.

 This view uses scene files described by the <a href="https://tangrams.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Overviews/Scene-File/">
 Tangram scene format</a> allowing you to fully customize your map using your own data.
 Some pre-made basemap styles can be found <a href="https://www.nextzen.org/">here</a> using Nextzen data sources.

 To use basemap styles you can <a href="https://developers.nextzen.org/"> sign up for an API key</a> and load it
 through your application:

 ```swift
 let sceneURL = URL("https://www.nextzen.org/carto/bubble-wrap-style/9/bubble-wrap-style.zip");
 let sceneUpdates = [ TGSceneUpdate(path: "global.sdk_api_key", value: "YOUR_API_KEY") ];
 view.loadScene(from: sceneURL, with: sceneUpdates);
 ```
 @note All the screen positions used in this inteface are in _logical pixel_ or _drawing coordinate system_ (based on a
 `UIKit` coordinate system), which is independent of the phone pixel density. Refer to the
 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/2DDrawing/Conceptual/DrawingPrintingiOS/GraphicsDrawingOverview/GraphicsDrawingOverview.html">Apple documentation</a>
 regarding _Coordinate Systems and Drawing in iOS_ for more information.

 @note This property is manipulated by the rendering subsystem depending on lifecycle events coming from the OS as well as certain events within Tangram itself. As such, do not expect your manipulation of individual settings (such as `paused`) to be long lived. An example of this is setting displayLink.paused to YES, then backgrounding and foregrounding the app. Tangram will respond to the OS lifecycle events and pause/unpause the map rendering, respectively, thereby overriding your setting. This is intended functionality and will not be changed.
 @note This property, even though it is marked NS_ASSUME_NONNULL at the top of the header, *will be nil* until the view is added to some kind of view hierarchy (window or subview). In a future PR we should clean up this assumption, but until then, you have been warned :)
