iOS
===

The recommended way to use tangram-es in an iOS project is to add it as a CocoaPods dependency. The library is hosted in CocoaPods under the pod name 'Tangram-es'. To find the latest version, check CocoaPods: https://cocoapods.org/pods/Tangram-es.
For convenience, we also provide Debug snapshots and Releases at [ios.mapzen.com](http://ios.mapzen.com/).

## Setup ##

This project uses CMake (minimum version 3.0), you can download it [here](http://www.cmake.org/download/) or use your favorite installation package tool like [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew install cmake
```

Make sure to update git submodules before you build:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

You can optionally install xcpretty to produce much prettier and more legible output during the build process:

```bash
gem install xcpretty
```

## Build ##

You will need a Mapzen API key to use the vector-tile and terrain service that is being used from the stylesheet of the demo app.
To get an API key visit: [mapzen.com/developers/](https://mapzen.com/developers/).

Building the iOS demo application requires Xcode 9.0 or newer. From the root directory of the project, run:

```bash
make ios MAPZEN_API_KEY=mapzen-xxxx
```

You can optionally append `DEBUG=1` or `RELEASE=1` to choose the build type.

> Note: DEBUG version of the framework does not have bitcode enabled. If you need bitcode, make sure to get RELEASE version of the framework.

This will generate an Xcode project that you can use to deploy on device or simulator:

```bash
open build/ios/tangram.xcodeproj
```

Make sure to set up the code signing identity and code sign the framework on copy (select target _tangram_ > _Build Phases_ > _Copy Files_ > _TangramMap.framework_ > _Code Sign On Copy_).

Note on Code Signing and Provisioning Profiles:
* For Simulator: Does not need any code signing identity, so you can ignore any provionining profile failures on target _tangram_ > _General_ > _Signing_.
* For Device: You will have to modify the _Bundle Identifier_ under target _tangram_ > _General_ > _Identity_ > _Bundle Identifier_, to something other than `com.mapzen.tangram`, since this needs to be unique.

For development, you can use the Makefile option `TANGRAM_IOS_FRAMEWORK_SLIM` to build for simulator only and faster your build times.

### iOS Binary Framework ###

An iOS binary framework bundle targeted for ARM architectures can be produced by running the following:

```bash
make ios-framework
```

The framework will be output in '/build/ios-framework/lib/', in a folder named 'release' or 'debug' according to the build type.

To build a universal binary working on both device and simulator architectures run the following:

```bash
make ios-framework-universal
```

The universal framework will be output in '/build/ios-framework-universal/', in a folder named 'release' or 'debug' according to the build type.
