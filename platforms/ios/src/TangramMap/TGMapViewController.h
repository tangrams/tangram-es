/**
 A gesture recognizer delegate that can be implemented to receive gesture events from the map view.
 The map view will first check whether a gestureDelegate is available, then check whether it responds
 to any `shouldRecognize*` method:

    - If the `TGRecognizerDelegate` responds to `shouldRecognize`, the map view calls it before proceeding with
    its default implementation based on the resturn status of `shouldRecognize`.

    - If the `TGRecognizerDelegate` doesn't respond to `shouldRecognize*`, the map view will proceed with
    calling default gesture handling code.

 Finally, the map view checks whether the `TGRecognizerDelegate` implements `didRecognize*` and call this
 method if so.

 @note Those methods are all **optional**.
 All the screen positions in this interface are in _logical pixel_ or _drawing coordinate system_
 (based on a `UIKit` coordinate system); which is independent of the phone pixel density. Refer the
 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/2DDrawing/Conceptual/DrawingPrintingiOS/GraphicsDrawingOverview/GraphicsDrawingOverview.html">Apple documentation</a>

/**
 `TGMapViewController` is a flexible and customizable map view managing the lifecycle of a
 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/glkit/glkview">GLKView</a> component.
 This view provides default gesture handlers for tap, double tap, long press, pan,
 pinch, rotate and shove.

 The public interface provides dynamic map marker placement, change of camera view
 settings, and map description changes through scene updates.

 This view uses scenes descibed by the
  <a href="https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/">Tangram YAML scene syntax</a>
 allowing you to fully customize your map description using your own data.
 Some pre-made basemap styles can be found
 <a href="https://mapzen.com/documentation/cartography/styles/">here</a> using Mapzen
 data sources.

 To use basemap styles you can <a href="https://mapzen.com/developers/sign_in">sign up for
 an API key</a> and load it through your application:

 ```swift
 let sceneURL = "https://mapzen.com/carto/walkabout-style-more-labels/walkabout-style-more-labels.yaml";
 view.loadSceneFile(sceneURL, sceneUpdates: [ TGSceneUpdate(path: "sources.mapzen.url_params", value: "{ api_key: \(YOUR_API_KEY) }") ]);
